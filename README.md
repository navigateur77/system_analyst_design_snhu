# System Analyst And Design Document Overview.

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

•	The purpose of this project is to build a new web application system.
•	The client is DriverPass company.
•	DriverPass wants the new system to be accessible from anywhere with a computer or a mobile phone and be able to do basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) actions.

## What did you do particularly well?
The system design was well structured with the incorporation of all actors and functionalities such as:
* Design of DriverPass System Class Diagram
* Design of DriverPass Use Case Diagram
* Activity Diagram
* Sequence Diagram

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If there is a document I would like to revisit it would be the "Business Requirements Documents".
I want to go deep on the Non-functional and functional requirements.
I would try to give more details on the system validation when it comes to user authentication and error handling.
An effort should also be put on the way the system could run on a cross-platform with high availability.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's need was interpreted through the DriverPass interview transcript.
This interview describes the way the company wants to design the system what the system will do and what the user expectations are.
Any project for system creation is based on the user story or user's need.
During a Scrum project (Agile) the main important parts are the user stories and the stakeholder's feedback.
This is a measure of the project objective and helps deliver at the end a robust, clean, secure, and user-friendly product.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software it is very important to have a clear understanding of requirements, think ahead of your functionality components, and divide your architecture into small pieces for performance.
You will also want to identify and quantify non-functional and functional requirements. Visualize your design and avoid choosing patterns.
Nowadays, there is not fit all techniques or strategies when it comes to system analyses and design but the most common system analyst techniques are:
* Block diagram (System analysis)
* Fault tree analysis (System analysis)
