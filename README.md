## System Analyst And Design Overview

## Project summary
AirgeadBankingApp is an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time.
- The app displays a summary of user saving account
- Prompt the user to enter information's related to:
    * Initial Investment Amount
    * Monthly Deposit
    * Annual Interest (Compounded)
    * Number of Years
The App wait for the user action to continue and display Two static reports.
The user can play around by changing information to see the report.

## What did you do particularly well?
The user interface was very well designed with font and background color.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code could be enhanced with user input validation and error handling code to take into account any error the program will encounter.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The monthly deposit report was a little bit challenging since I must check the number of years and after that check for the number of months in a nested while loop. I used courses resources on loops and other online sites like Stack Overflow to overcome the challenge.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Module class programming and Header class programming are very good skills to keep and transfer to another project.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is maintainable and adaptable because it is based on class module coding. The code is readable because I apply the industry standard on code readability with spaces and naming. Outline comments and inline comments make the code readable too.
